Limitations:

1) All CPUs should have the same number of cores.
   Other configurations will not adapt properly.
2) MSB methods must use exactly 64 threads
   due to implementing only 64-way range partition.
3) MSB methods need a large fudge factor or a small
   block, otherwise the algorithm will be unable to
   distribute blocks across NUMA regions correctly.
3) MSB methods are implemented to run on full
   32-bit data
+
4) Should install PAPI Library first, if want to run this experiments to measure the energy. In my platform, the PAPI Library is installed in the /usr/local/ directory. PAPI Version: 5.5.1.0
